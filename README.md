📺 Screen Share Test Application

A React-based frontend application that demonstrates browser screen-sharing permissions, media stream lifecycle management, robust success and failure handling, and proper resource cleanup using native Web APIs.

🚀 Project Overview

This project was built as part of a frontend shortlisting task. The objective was to create a clean and reliable screen-sharing test application that:

Verifies browser support for screen sharing

Requests and manages screen-sharing permissions

Displays a live preview of the shared screen

Extracts and displays media stream metadata

Detects when screen sharing stops (manually or externally)

Properly cleans up media tracks to prevent leaks

Handles all states with clear UI feedback

The application uses React (Vite) and native browser Web APIs, without relying on any third-party screen-sharing libraries.

🏗️ Tech Stack

React (Vite)

JavaScript (ES6+)

React Router

Native Browser Web APIs (navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia)

Plain CSS (no UI libraries)

🖥️ Application Flow
1️⃣ Homepage (/)

Displays title: Screen Share Test App

Verifies support for:

navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia

If unsupported, displays a browser compatibility message

If supported, navigates to /screen-test

2️⃣ Screen Test Page (/screen-test)
🔹 Permission Handling

When the user clicks Start Screen Sharing:

App transitions to a "requesting" state

Calls:

navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia({
  video: { frameRate: { ideal: 30 } },
  audio: false
})

Handles distinct states:

Requesting permission

Permission granted

User cancelled

Permission denied

Unknown error

The UI reflects each state individually instead of using generic error handling.

🔹 Live Screen Preview & Metadata

After permission is granted:

The MediaStream is attached to a <video> element using:

video.srcObject = stream

Metadata is extracted using:

track.getSettings()

Displays:

Resolution

Frame rate

Display surface type (tab / window / monitor)

⚠️ No recording or backend streaming is implemented — preview is local only.

🔹 Stream Lifecycle Detection

The application listens for:

track.onended

This detects when:

The user manually stops screen sharing from the browser UI

The browser ends the stream unexpectedly

When detected:

All media tracks are stopped

Stream references are cleared

UI updates immediately to reflect the stopped state

3️⃣ End / Retry Flow

After screen sharing stops:

Displays "Screen sharing stopped"

Provides:

Retry Screen Test

Back to Home

Retry behavior ensures:

A fresh getDisplayMedia request is initiated

Previous streams are not reused

Media tracks are properly released

Cleanup is handled:

On manual stop

On browser-triggered stop

On component unmount

This prevents media leaks and ensures proper resource management.

🧠 Architecture Decision

All screen-sharing logic is isolated inside a custom hook:

useScreenShare()

This ensures:

Separation of concerns

Clean and declarative UI components

Controlled side-effect management

Maintainable and scalable structure

🛡️ Error Handling & States

Distinct UI states are implemented for:

idle

requesting

granted

cancelled

denied

error

stopped

Each state has a clear and specific UI representation.

🌍 Browser Support

Tested in:

Google Chrome

Microsoft Edge

⚠️ Safari has limited support for getDisplayMedia.

📦 Setup Instructions

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

npm install
npm run dev

Then open:

http://localhost:5173
📌 Known Limitations

Safari has limited or partial support for screen sharing

Some systems may show a black preview when sharing the same tab due to browser security restrictions

Display surface type may not be available in older browser versions

🎯 Key Requirements Covered

Native Web API usage

MediaStream lifecycle management

Proper cleanup handling

Custom hook architecture

Retry flow without stream reuse

Clear state-based UI rendering

No third-party screen-sharing libraries
